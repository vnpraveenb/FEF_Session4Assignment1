            Without getting overcomplicated with the W3C’s technical definition, a pseudo-class is basically a phantom state or specific characteristic of an element that can be targeted with CSS. A few common pseudo-classes are :link, :visited, :hover, :active, :first-child and :nth-child. There are more, and we’re going to see them all in a minute.
